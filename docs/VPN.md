# WireGuard VPN

## Server setup
To use the VPN feature you need a running [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) server to connect to.

The installation instructions are best covered on the official Wireguard website: [https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

Next steps are covered in their quickstart guide: [https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/).

!!! note "Terminology" 

    While Wireguard uses _peers_ in their terminology, we will refer to the UZG device as ___peer___ and to the Wireguard server as ___server___.

### Keys

#### Private/Public key-pair

Peer authentication is achieved using a private/public key-pair.
To generate the keys you can use the built-in wg command:

```
$ mkdir wg-keys
$ cd wg-keys
$ umask 077
$ wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```
This will create two files with private and public key respectively. You can use those later in the configuration process.

Each peer (and server) should have a unique key-pair. Private keys should only ever be known to the "owner" of the key-pair, wheras public key can be shared with other peers or servers.

#### Pre-shared key

Optionally, you can add another layer of cryptographic protection to your VPN with the PreSharedKey. It adds a layer of symmetric-key cryptography to the traffic between specific peers.

You can generate the key using the wg command:

`$ wg genpsk > psk`

#### Config generator

There is also a handy config generator website: [https://www.wireguardconfig.com/](https://www.wireguardconfig.com/). 
Make sure to note the _Random seed_ so you can replicate the configuration and keys if needed.

## Wireguard peer configuration

### WireGuard Interface Settings

* __IP address of the local interface__

    This is the local peer IP address of the WireGuard interface. It should match `AllowedIPs` section in server config.

* __Local Subnet__

    The subnet for the local peer IP address. If unsure, a safe bet would be `255.255.255.0`.

* __Local port__

    Port number of the local interface, normally `33333`.

* __Local Gateway__

    A gateway to use on the VPN interface. It can be either the Wireguard server IP (see [Example](#example)) or `0.0.0.0`.

* __Private key of the local interface__

    The private key of the local peer. (see [Private/Public key-pair](#privatepublic-key-pair))

* __Address of the endpoint peer__

    Address of the WG server

* __Public key of the endpoint peer__

    The public key of the WG server. (see [Private/Public key-pair](#privatepublic-key-pair))

* __Port of the endpoint peer__

    Port of the WG server, normally `51820`

* __Allowed IPs__

    A comma separated list of the IPs allowed to connect to this device via WG

* __Allowed Subnet__

    A comma separated list of the subnets allowed to connect to this device via WG

* __Make default__

    Use this as the default Wireguard configuration.

* __Pre-shared key__

    Optional key to encrypt traffic between peers (see [Pre-shared key](#pre-shared-key)). Leave blank if unused. 

## Example

!!! warning "Demo data" 

    Please generate new keys and use appropriate IP ranges for use in real life scenarios! (see [Private/Public key-pair](#privatepublic-key-pair))

| | Server | Peer |
|-:|:-:|:-:|
| Public IP | 1.2.3.4 | \*.\*.\*.\* |
| Wireguard IP | 10.100.0.1 | 10.100.0.2 |
| Private key | Server+PrivateKey= | Peer+PrivateKey= |
| Public key | Server+PublicKey= | Peer+PublicKey= |
| Port | 51820 | 33333 |


### Server config

An example entry of the _/etc/wg0.conf_:

```
[Interface]
Address = 10.100.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = Server+PrivateKey=

[Peer]
PublicKey = Peer+PublicKey=
AllowedIPs = 10.100.0.2/32
```
